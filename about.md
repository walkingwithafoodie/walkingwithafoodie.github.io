### Family Upbringing

Nothing in the world brings people together like food. Many people in the world have said this type of phrase before but for me it’s true. I am nothing but a self-taught cook with a passion for food. This is the humble story of my life through food. I have been cooking in my Grandma’s kitchen for as long as I can remember.

As a family, food was always the center of everything not just a holiday or birthday but every day at 10 am and 3:30 pm the men would come in from the field for an afternoon pop and cookie, and dinner was served at exactly 12 pm and supper was at 6 pm. Each meal or snack would require thought and preparation. Every time that I was at my Grandparent’s house and I would help cook every meal and more. From then on I fell in love with cooking and feeding people.

This passion grew into watching Julia Child and Jacques Pépin on Saturday morning, to watching the food network and learning everything that I could about cooking and food. When I was a teenager I started going to my Aunt’s house for the summer and there I could even further my passion because she loved food as much as I did.

## Living through food

While going to college I began to experiment more and more especially with Indian and Asian flavors. It was also helpful that my best friend is from Malaysia and showed me how to make a wonderful curry. During all of this experimentation I met the love of my life and began to share my passion with him. Now that we are engaged I get to share my passion for food with someone I love every day of my life. I love to create new things and experiment with old flavors. To me there is nothing better in life than sharing a great meal with someone you love. 

I hope I can inspire you or someone you know because cooking can be truly fun and exciting.
