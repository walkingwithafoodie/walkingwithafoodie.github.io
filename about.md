### Family Upbringing

I need inspiration at times that doesn't just come from a single ingredient, a trip to Whole Foods, or the Farmers Market, so I often follow top notch chefs, gather inspiration from Food and Wine, Food Network tv shows, or as of late, Modernist Cuisine. By no means is the list of magazines, books and more what I have learned the most from or have, but these should get you started.

## Living through food

While going to college I began to experiment more and more especially with Indian and Asian flavors. It was also helpful that my best friend is from Malaysia and showed me how to make a wonderful curry. During all of this experimentation I met the love of my life and began to share my passion with him. Now that we are engaged I get to share my passion for food with someone I love every day of my life. I love to create new things and experiment with old flavors. To me there is nothing better in life than sharing a great meal with someone you love. 

I hope I can inspire you or someone you know because cooking can be truly fun and exciting.
