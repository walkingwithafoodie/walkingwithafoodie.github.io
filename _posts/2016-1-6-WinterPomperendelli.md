Winter Pomperendelli

Zucchini, Mushrooms, Garlic, lemon zest, Dinosaur and Red Kale until bright green. Cool. Then put the sliced Kielbasa on the heat, the fat rendering out will be used to make the rue.

The trick to this dish is having the sauce completely done before the pasta comes out. This is because fresh pasta requires 3 minutes to cook, if you aren't ready, your pasta will be done way too early compared to the rest of your dish.

The rue. Using the same pan as the veggies and rendered fat from the kielbasa, make a light colored rue, is this case I had fortified stock instead of plain stock, and added crème fraiche because I wanted the dish to be a light tangy sauce, not a thick rich sauce (like spaghetti sauce) that would overpower the fresh pasta. The longer this sauce simmers the better it will be.

Tasting it, yum. It's getting there.

We're waiting to put the veggies in the sauce until the noodles start to cook, because otherwise the veggies will be over cooked.

While we wait, a long counter is necessary with a sheet tray very lightly dusted with Double O flour. About 10 minutes left of our hour wait for the pasta dough and it feels moist, the gluten has developed and will give us the toothy texture we look for, when we roll it out, it will be able to be very long. If you don't wait and hour (or just do 25 minutes like some TV challenges do) the result will be crumbly and not quite right.

You need a lot of space, continue to clear of your counter and put on the pasta attachment. I choose not to use a crank version because it's quite difficult to work with a lot of pasta, can be done, but after once you'll buy the KitchenAid attachment you will never go back.

Side note: Flavored pasta are created by putting mushroom or spinach directly into the dough. Saffron can also be used by putting it's steeped water (to bloom it) into the dough. There are lots of variations, but you have to be really great at what it should feel like (too dry? too wet and need to add flour?) Gotta know all that before playing with flavor.

Guess what? It's time to start.

Unwrapping the pasta dough and feeling it, it's slightly sticky and when cutting one into six should be tough attachment l and flatten one of those 6 into a triangle or rectangle. Then on the roller’s widest setting I pass the dough through. Then I fold the dough into 3rds and pass the small end through the roller again. This is called kneading the dough and I continue this process with the rest of the dough pieces. Being careful to capture it on the backs of my hands as not to leave finger dimples in the dough and to keep all the pieces covered when not working with them.

Now it's time to make it thinner. We do this in stages to let it relax, going from step 1 to thickness 3 can tear the dough and that's not fun.

Sprinkle each piece with flour, to keep it from sticking and shake off any extra. It's all about feel if you need the additional flour, if it sticks to your hand it'll stick to the machine. Now start again with 3 for pomperendelli ( fat thick noodles). Next roll loosely and cut into .75 inch pieces and unroll one at a time. You are done with one of the pieces, now repeat that last step for each of your pieces.

If you roll thinner and cut thinner, it could be spaghetti or Fettuccine noodles. The thicker they are the longer it takes to dry and the possibility of moisture remaining while storing and it going bad.


I made 2 batches one of pappardelle and one fettuccine. The pappardelle is for the dish and the fettuccine is to dry. When making pasta I tend to always dry some since I am making some anyway. When drying noodles place them on a drying rack until they crack and fall off. Since they will crack in half make sure to double the length that you want. If you use them fresh cut them to length before running them through the cutter.

While the pasta is waiting to go in place them on a half rack dusted with flour and covered with a towel. This keeps them fresh and from sticking together.

Check your sauce, it might be too thick by now.Taste and add more stock or water until sauce is thinly covering the back of a spoon and when you drag your finger through it the line stays. Then add veggies and mix. Also be careful not to over sauce your pasta. We really want to highlight the freshness of the pasta and not to hide it with an overpowering thick heavy sauce.

Now cook the pasta. Fresh pasta takes no time at all. Once you put it in stir and wait until they float. Taste one to make sure it's al dente. Mine only took a minute. Then add drained pasta  to the sauce and toss together.

I LOVE to plate pasta like this in a big bowl and finish it with some good hard cheese lemon zest and citrus finishing oil.

Nothing sexier than hand made pasta, just saying

When tasting the dish I get notes of smokiness from the Kielbasa, richness of the dish removed with the citrus, tanginess from the crème fraiche ,`grassy quality from the kale, slight nuttiness from the fond. Overall this was an excellent dish using what is in season and highlighting the fresh pasta and a good learning opportunity for my husband.
