Farmers market season is upon us in South Dakota and the growing season has spurred a lot of different things with our hot and humid weather. Butter Lettuce, scallions, salad turnips, and small carrots were some of the delicious fresh vegatables at last weeks market. From our garden we grabbed chive blossoms and surprizingly found Head on Shrimp from the local grocery store :) Not only did I get vegetables but my favorite vendor gave me a bouquet of fresh flowers, which are making my home smell beautiful.

With all of the fresh vegetables, I couldn't help but make a great salad. So I decided to sous vide some small beautiful carrots with butter and mild marsala and in a separate pouch I sous vide salad turnips. For the dressing I infused lemongrass into coconut milk and then added lime juice and a bunch of cilantro. The best part of the salad were the vegetables, but the most visual were the marsala finished, head on shrimp, which were standing to attention. I not only had cooked vegetables but also finished the plate with raw scallions, snap peas, pea shoots and a chive blossom. In addition to the dressing on the bottom of the plate, I finished the plate with a bit on top of each of the vegetables. This dish was not only delicious but easily my most gorgeous dish this far. 

I strive to push myself and be inspired by the pure beauty in the ingredients that I find. And that is why I love farmers market seasons.
