Farmers market season is upon us in South Dakota and the growing season has spurred a lot of different things with our hot and humid weather. At last weeks market, I found some delicious fresh vegetables, some of which were butter lettuce and scallions. Not only did I get vegetables but my favorite vendor gave me a bouquet of fresh flowers, which are making my home smell beautiful.

With all of the fresh vegetables, I couldn't help but make a great salad. So I decided to sous vide some small beautiful carrots with butter and mild marsala and in a separate pouch I sous vide salad turnips. For the dressing I infused lemongrass into coconut milk and then added lime juice and a bunch of cilantro. The best part of the salad were the vegetables, but the most visual were the marsala finished, head on shrimp, which were standing to attention. I not only had cooked vegetables but also finished the plate with raw scallions, snap peas, pea shoots and a chive blossom. In addition to the dressing on the bottom of the plate, I finished the plate with a bit on top of each of the vegetables. This dish was not only delicious but easily my most gorgeous dish this far. 

I strive to push myself and be inspired by the pure beauty in the ingredients that I find. And that is why I love farmers market seasons.
