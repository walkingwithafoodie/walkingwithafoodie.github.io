To my husband and I there is nothing more relaxing than going camping. This past memorial day weekend the two of us went camping with a couple of close friends. All of us happen to love food and cocktails, thus we never went hungry and came back with just about as much food as we left with. However, we found out Grizzly dosen't like dirt, he often found paper to sit on instead of the ground, even if we moved it across the campsite. :)

Even though we were camping, the quality of food did not diminish. Over the course of three days we split up the meals so that neither couple would have to be more putout than the other. My dishes included pulled pork with coleslaw grilled veggies and Greek feta salad and succotash. My pulled pork was sous vide with a rub on it made from fennel seeds, oregano, paprika, brown mustard, bay leaves, japones, chipotles, and guajiilo chilies. At the campsite we charred it over the open fire, pulled it apart, and then finished with my homemade bourbon chili BBQ sauce. But, one last thing for the sandwich, a creamy acidic coleslaw was made (at home) to top the pork.  

I made it with red and green cabbage that I had salted overnight and then rinsed and mixed with just mayo, onion powder, granulated garlic, red wine vinegar, olive oil, salt, pepper and a pinch of sugar. The Greek salad component was very easy to make it combines cumber, red onion, tomatoes, and feta cheese all thinly sliced. Then finished with a red wine vinaigrette and it creates a bit of a pickled flavor which makes it go very well with rich pork. The Greek salad and coleslaw were actually made before going camping and vacuum packed so that water wouldn't get into them from the melting ice. The last thing I made while camping was a succotash. This was because it was very easy and I had a bunch of grill-able veggies and some shredded chicken to add more protein for my runner husband. I charred some corn previously frozen from last year, and some edamame instead of lima beans. I also added asparagus, onions, bacon cooked over the open flame, onions, garlic, and mushrooms. Since I didn't have jalapenos I used cayenne for the spice and chicory root for some coffee bitter notes. 

### Organization while camping
One of my favorite items was a stack-able pill organizers, which held small amounts of spices to keep everything flavorful, without the need to bring the entire cupboard and the spills associated with that. Cooking over an open flame was a bit challenging since the majority of the time it was raining or quite windy, however we pulled through, even if the rain got to us a bit and considered going to town for a movie break. Griz survived, and we survived the trip up and back with a five pups and a Tetris like packed car.

Even after being wet, cold, dirty, and tired for most of the weekend, we had a great time involving great food. I can't wait to go camping again.
