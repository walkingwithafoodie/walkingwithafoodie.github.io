A few months ago I made a rabbit stew and my fiancee keeps begging for another one. Since its been cold and rainy for a couple of days I decided to make him one. Last time I made a Moroccan tagine inspired stew but this time I had a bunch of fresh cherries so I decided to play with fruity flavors along with the rabbit.

###Prepping Fresh Vegetables
I started by prepping a bunch of fresh vegetables such as carrots, dikon radish, mushrooms, onion, fava beans, green and red peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, and a few more. In other words I just used all of the different vegetables that were in my fridge you can do the same you really just want to have hard vegetables because this will cook for hours.

I also needed to prepare the cherries for the cherry compote. Since I wanted them to be pretty whole I needed to figure out how to pit them with out a cherry pitter. I found that the (paperclip technique seen in this video)[https://youtube.googleapis.com/v/19Z2T2ECyZA&source=ud] worked really well but after doing three pounds of cherries my finger tips were really sore.

###Stewing Hen vs Rabbit###
Next I broke down the rabbit. This is basically the same as [breaking down a chicken](http://www.walkingwithafoodie.com/how-to-butcher-a-chicken) which you could use here instead of rabbit but something more gamy is better. Also if you decide to use chicken make sure you get a stewing hen because it needs to be tougher than a basic frying chicken.

Finally I could get to cooking. In a large enameled cast iron dutch oven over high heat I browned all of the rabbit pieces and then placed them on a wire rack inside of a half rack. The pieces of rabbit are not cooked through yet just browned on all sides. After all of the pieces of rabbit are browned and removed from the pan I placed all of the vegetables in to brown. Once the vegetables were brown I made a hot spot in the center of the pan and placed the tomato paste in the center to cook a bit. If you don't cook tomato paste it dose not taste very good but when it has been cooked down its amazing.

###Braising with Red Wine and Chicken Stock###
Once the tomato paste was cooked I added about a bottle of red wine. I had a cabernet sauvignon by carnivor which I had leftover from another night which has some fruity flavors. Once the wine had reduced by about half I added the rabbit back and proceed to add enough homemade chicken stock to come up to half of the pan. See [Amazing Grilled Chicken](http://www.walkingwithafoodie.com/spice-rubbed-grilled-chicken) for how to make a chicken stock. Once the pan had come up to a boil again I placed the dutch oven in a 400 degree oven for about an hour. It is very important to use a pan that can be placed in the oven if not using cast iron.

###Cherry Compote###
While the rabbit was braising I started to make the cherry compote. I sauteed some onion, chopped garlic, cinnamon sticks, cloves, and a cardamom pod until the onions were translucent and I could smell the spices. Then I added enough cherries to cover the bottom of the pan in a single layer. I added a good amount of salt, sugar and champagne vinegar then I covered it and let it cook down until the cherries were soft and the juices had thickened.

###Rice, Couscous, or Polenta? ###
The last component of the dish was a base. Sometimes I use rice or couscous but this time I used soft polenta. I like this because of the creaminess that it gives to the stew when you eat it all together.

Finally I got to plate it all together and eat it. I put a good amount of the polenta in the bottom of the bowl. topped with the vegetables and sauce from the stew. Then I
put two pieces of the rabbit on top

Finished it with some of the compote and micro greens.

###Happy cooking###
This dish turned out great and my fiancee loved it. This is more of a winter time dish but since it was cold and rainy it worked quite well. I can't wait to try out more ideas with rabbit but in the mean time I hope you enjoy this and happy cooking.
