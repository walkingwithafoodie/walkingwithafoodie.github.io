I'm available for personalized cooking lessons for yourself, a friend, or a group of people. Pick a cuisine type  that you would like to learn more about, gather inspiration from, or which step in cooking your struggling the most in and I can most likely help you learn by letting you follow along with your own cutting board, chefs knife and ingredients. Each class comes with a copy of all of the recipes used and a notepad and pen for taking notes during the class oh and food of course.

Please note some of the classes come with an optional welcome basket that I suggest with each class. You also have the option to add one of these baskets to the class of your choice.

Thank you for your time and consideration, please let me know how I can help you peruse your interest in food.
